--------BUILDING COMICS 1.0-----------------------------------------------------

In order to build the command-line version of COMICS it is most convenient to 
use the GNU build system (Autotools). 
The following non-standard packages have to be installed:
	• A Java Development Kit (JDK) (You need a complete JDK, not only a JRE!)
	• GNU Automatic Configure Script Builder (autoconf)
	• GNU Generic Library Support Script (libtool)
	• GNU C++ Compiler (g++)
The GUI comes as a runnable JAR-file but needs the C++-source code to be 
compiled as JNI shared libraries. 
If you are inside the comics-1.0 src directory, this will altogether be done by
executing

	./build comics.sh "path to java"

which is the easiest way to build COMICS. 
If you add as a parameter your JAVA HOME, which is the path to your JDK 
installation, or your JAVA HOME is already set system-wide, the necessary
JNI libraries are built by this script. 
Please make sure that you have a complete Java Developement Kid installed! 
If your JDK is, e. g., the OpenJDK Developement Kid, possible ways
to build COMICS complete and properly are:

	(a) ./build comics.sh /usr/lib/jvm/java-6-openjdk

	(b) export JAVA HOME=/usr/lib/jvm/java-6-openjdk
	   ./build comics.sh

	(c) ./build comics.sh (and JAVA HOME is already set)

An indication of problems with building the JNI-libraries is the GUI throwing 
an JAVA exception when calling Model Checking or Search Counterexample. 
We have tested the compilation process both on 64bit and 32bit Debian systems 
using

	• OpenJDK Development Kid 6 (openjdk-6-jdk)
	• GNU Autoconf 2.65
	• GNU Libtool 2.2.6b
	• g++ 4.4.3

--------RUNNING COMICS 1.0-----------------------------------------------------

After the C++-sources are successfully built, you can start the command-line 
version of COMICS by typing
	
	./comics.sh

and the GUI-version by typing

	./xcomics.sh
